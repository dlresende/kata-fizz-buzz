# Fizz Buzz Kata

Build a program that takes a number N as input and for each number from 1 to N:

- If the number is divisible by 3, should print "Fizz";
- If the number is divisible by 5, should print "Buzz";
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, should print "FizzBuzz";
- Otherwise, should print the number.

Example:
```shell
$ fizzbuzz 15
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
